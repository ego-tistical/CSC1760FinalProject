# Final Project for CSC 1760 Introduction to Programming

## Final Project: Math Application

### Criteria

This project is to write a program that takes input from the user and calculate area and volume of rectangle, 
circle, right triangle, cylinder, and sphere and draw a rectangle.  
 
Display a menu to the user that has the following options:

--- Main Menu --- 
1. Calculate Area 
2. Calculate Volume 
3. Draws a rectangle   
4. Exit 
 
a. Write a switch statement that handles the userâ€™s choice. For each of the main menu options, display a 
submenu that has the following options: 

--- Area Menu ---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- Volume Menu --- 
a. Rectangle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Cylinder 
b. Circle     				b. Sphere 
c. Right Triangle     			c. Main menu                                               
d. Main menu 
 
b.  Write  nested  switch  statements  and  methods  to  handle  each  of  the  submenus.  For  all  of  the  switch 
statements,  use  the  default  case  to  handle  any  incorrect  menu  options.  If  you  are  unsure  of  the  correct 
formulas, research them on the Internet or in your math books. Display the results of each of the calculations 
based on the appropriate user input.  
 
c. Write a method (3. Draws a rectangle) that draws a rectangle on the screen using ASCII characters. This 
method will prompt the user for the height and width of the rectangle. Use the following ASCII values for 
the box characters: 218 upper left-hand corner, 217 lower right-hand corner, 196 top and bottom, 192 lower 
left-hand corner, 191 upper right-hand corner, and 179 left and right sides.  
 
d. Return to the main menu after completing the execution of each submenu.
